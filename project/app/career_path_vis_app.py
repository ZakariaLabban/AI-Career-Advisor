    This interactive graph visualizes a potential career progression in the industry.

    **Nodes** represent different stages in the career path:
    - **Job**: The job titles at various stages of career progression.
    - **Course**: Recommended courses or skills needed for a specific job role.
    - **Project**: Suggested hands-on projects that align with the job and course for real-world experience.

    **Arrows (Edges)** represent the connections between jobs, courses, and projects:
    - **Job -> Course**: This indicates which course or skills are needed to progress to the next job role.
    - **Job -> Project**: This suggests which types of projects can help you gain experience for that job.
    - **Job -> Job**: These edges show how one job can naturally lead to another in a career progression.

    **Use this visualization as a guide** for your career development. Start with foundational skills and projects, and keep progressing toward advanced roles!
